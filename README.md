Group Team Members: Anna Rischitelli, Priya Arunachalam, Nataliia Sokolova, Vincent Durcan, and Shadia Duery

### Question:
Does an increase bicycling does it impact transportation emissions in Seattle and Portland? Is there a difference between the two cities?

### Goals: 
Determine if an increase or decrease in cycling (or other outdoor activity types) affect transporation emission in Seattle and Portland.



### Project Description:

1) Your task is to answer a business question by telling a story with data visualizations

2) Focus on providing users an interactive means to explore data themselves

3) Prepare a 10-minute presentation that communicates the executive summary of your findings

4) You may choose a project of any theme, but we encourage you to think broadly

5) You will have an ample time in class to work with your group, but expect to put in hours outside of class as well

### Requirements:

1) Your visualizations must include a Python Flask-powered API, HTML/CSS, JavaScript and at least on database (SQL, MongoDB, SQLite)

2) Your project should fall into one of the below four tracks:
- A custome "creative" D3.js project (an interactive visualization)
- A combination of web scraping and Leaflet or Plotly
- A dashboard page with multiple charts that update from the same data
- A "thick" server that performs multiple manipulations on data in a database prior to visualization 

3) Your project should include at least on JS library that we did not cover

4) Your project must be powered by a data set with at least 100 records

5) Your project must include some level of user-driven interactions (e.g. menus, dropdowns, textboxes)

6) Your final visualization should include at least three views.
