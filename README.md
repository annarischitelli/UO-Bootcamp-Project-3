## BEST CAMPING IN OREGON ##

Group Team Members: Anna Rischitelli, Priya Anulacharam, Nataliia Sokolova, Vincent Durcan, and Shadia Duery

Question: What is the best campground based on your available vacation time of year in Oregon? 

Goals: 
1) We are providing different camping options and merging it with this information:
    - avg. high
    - avg. low
    - avg. precipitation
    - map layer with closest grocery store
    - map layer with closest gas station
    - map layer with cloeset hospital (bonus?)
2) Web scaping for news about camping or weather

Project Description:

1) Your task is to answer a business question by telling a story with data visualizations

2) Focus on providing users an interactive means to explore data themselves

3) Prepare a 10-minute presentation that communicates the executive summary of your findings

4) You may choose a project of any theme, but we encourage you to think broadly

5) You will have an ample time in class to work with your group, but expect to put in hours outside of class as well

Requirements:

1) Your visualizations must include a Python Flask-powered API, HTML/CSS, JavaScript and at least on database (SQL, MongoDB, SQLite)

2) Your project should fall into one of the below four tracks:
- A custome "creative" D3.js project (an interactive visualization)
- A combination of web scraping and Leaflet or Plotly
- A dashboard page with multiple charts that update from the same data
- A "thick" server that performs multiple manipulations on data in a database prior to visualization 

3) Your project should include at least on JS library that we did not cover

4) Your project must be powered by a data set with at least 100 records

5) Your project must include some level of user-driven interactions (e.g. menus, dropdowns, textboxes)

6) Your final visualization should include at least three views.
