## Commuting vs. Transportation Emissions

Group Team Members: Anna Rischitelli, Priya Arunachalam, Nataliia Sokolova, Vincent Durcan, and Shadia Duery

### Question:
Does the population density of a city affect transportation emissions (in top 50 cities in the US by population)? 

Hypothesis: A city with high population density would have a decrease in transportation emissions. 

Primary goals:
- Overall emissions of a city
- Population density of each city
- 

Add ons:
- Commute numbers
- City planning initiatives
- Centralized public transportation
- Forecast emissions based on population growth

## Visualization
1. Heat map / bubble map - map our cities and create a bubble based on a normalized population with map layer for emissions

2. Scatter plot - pop.density vs. emissions

3. 

## Data Sources
- Population (Vincent's data)
- Transportation emissions (Nataliia's data)
- Land size to create population density

### Project Description:

1) Your task is to answer a business question by telling a story with data visualizations

2) Focus on providing users an interactive means to explore data themselves

3) Prepare a 10-minute presentation that communicates the executive summary of your findings

4) You may choose a project of any theme, but we encourage you to think broadly

5) You will have an ample time in class to work with your group, but expect to put in hours outside of class as well

### Requirements:

1) Your visualizations must include a Python Flask-powered API, HTML/CSS, JavaScript and at least on database (SQL, MongoDB, SQLite)

2) Your project should fall into one of the below four tracks:
- A custome "creative" D3.js project (an interactive visualization)
- A combination of web scraping and Leaflet or Plotly
- A dashboard page with multiple charts that update from the same data
- A "thick" server that performs multiple manipulations on data in a database prior to visualization 

3) Your project should include at least on JS library that we did not cover

4) Your project must be powered by a data set with at least 100 records

5) Your project must include some level of user-driven interactions (e.g. menus, dropdowns, textboxes)

6) Your final visualization should include at least three views.



## Final Readme should include:

This is the database that is used

This is how to run the included code to insert data into the DB

This is how to run the code to spin up the web app and view the visualizations
